## The 3 big tasks behind analyzing textual Twitter data
### 1. Scrape data

This is how you scrape data

#### Packages needed

#### Set up credentials

#### Search what you want

### 2. Prepare data

#### Remove stop words

#### Remove punctuation

#### Tokenize words

#### Create DTM

### 3. Analyze data

#### Exploratory analysis

#### Natural language processing

##### Visualize topiccs

##### Visualize co-occurring terms


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
